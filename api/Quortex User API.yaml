    ## introduction

    The Quortex platform generates events when resources are created, updated, deleted, and when the status of a resource changes. These events appear in [the Event API](/#operation/events_list) and in the "Event log" area of the UI.

    Each of these events can trigger a call to an external service by configuring a webhook on the platform.

    ## text webhooks

    The Quortex platform webhooks can be used to send messages on three popular chat applications:

    - Microsoft Teams
    - Google Chat
    - Slack

    ## raw webhooks

    For every other purposes, "raw" webhooks can be used, so a JSON payload is posted.

    > **This raw webhook API is still under development. We may introduce breaking changes.**

    ### raw payload fields

    | Name              | Type   | Required? | Description |
    | ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- |
    | application       | string | Yes       | This is the application concerned by this event. |
    | category          | string | Yes       | This is the resource type of the event. This can be used to determine the objet represented by the "resource_uuid" field. |
    | operation         | string | Yes       | Nature of the event.  |
    | resource_uuid     | string | Yes       | The identifier of the resource the event is about. |
    | organization_uuid | string | Yes       | Organization identifier. Useful when a single webhook URL is used in many Quortex organizations. |
